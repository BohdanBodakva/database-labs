# Lab1
1. Create database
2. Build all necessary objects (tables, primary keys, secondary keys, foreign keys,
indexes, check constraints) for the specified database
3. Enter at least 10 abstract records in each database table (if the number, of course
not limited to logic)
4. Create a diagram for a fully designed database. Tables should be displayed on
chart in standard mode (columnname, datatype, allow null) Relationships between
adjust the tables in such a way as to indicate between which columns they are
establish a connection



# Task:
Create a relational database schema that allows you to store data
about the state of health of light patients in the hospital (take into account6 that in the system
there may be more than one patient and more than one hospital). Health data is taken from trackers (pressure, temperature, heart rate) and on
based on doctor's consultations (which must also be in the system)
